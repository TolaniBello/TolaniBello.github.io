what_i_learned: |
  I learned about dependent and independent variable and how AI works with these variables, it was quite interactive. Dr. Gabrielle Waters also spoke about RAG, definitely need to read more on that. She spoke about how to manipulate data and formulating research questions. 
  
  We played a game using spaghetti sticks, marshmallow, and tapes to build the strongest and tallest tower: I learned about the importance of strategizing and time management because, when we saw we were short on time, we started rushing to finish and made a lot of mistakes. 

  Today also, I went through some literature papers or articles relating to what me and my project members will be working on this summer and it gave me an overview of what to expect, what to practice on, and what method other people employed to bring their project to reality.

  

blockers: |
  When reviewing these papers and articles, I came across a lot of terms and definitions I barely know anything about but I will ensure to read them again and have a good understanding of what they all mean.

reflection: |
  It was fun all in all, especially because today was the first day we all met in person. We reintroduced ourselves, took some pictures, and played a game, which helped break the ice and made things feel more real. Being around everyone in the same space brought a new kind of energy to the group. I really want to make an effort to do this project well and take full advantage of the opportunity. I'm also excited to keep learning more about machine learning and growing my skills in Python programming.
