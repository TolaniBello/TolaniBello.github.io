  Today, we picked up from where we left off yesterday and continued working on cleaning our dataset. We removed the null values and created a new column based on the type of cancer diagnosis to indicate whether each case was malignant or not. Using the mapping function made it easier to add this new column and organize the data clearly. After that, we proceeded to merge the datasets, building on the process we developed earlier in the week.

  We also recorded our weekly video update, summarizing everything we worked on throughout the week and sharing what we plan to accomplish next. It was a good moment to reflect, and honestly, we covered a lot—it’s been a really busy and productive week. Seeing how far we’ve come made me feel proud of the work we’re doing and excited for what’s ahead.

  We ran into some trouble figuring out where the errors were when the code didn’t give us the results we expected. It took a lot of time, backtracking, and researching to understand what was going wrong but in the end, we were able to resolve it.

  This week was a good mix of work and small wins. We spent most of the day continuing with our dataset—removing null values, creating a new column to show whether each diagnosis was malignant, and merging the cleaned data. There were some challenges along the way, especially when our code didn’t return the results we expected, but after a lot of backtracking and research, we finally figured it out. It felt good to push through and get it working.
  We also recorded our weekly video to reflect on what we accomplished this week and what we’re aiming for next. It’s been a busy and productive week.
