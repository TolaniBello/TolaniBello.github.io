  We began the day by watching elevator pitch videos from past CEAMLS participants. It was inspiring to see how they presented their work in such a concise and confident manner. Dr. Mack also addressed us and gave important guidance on how our final research paper should look and what key elements it must include.

  After that, Michael gave us a walkthrough of how to use Overleaf to collaboratively write and format our research paper. He showed us how to use the IEEE bibliography style, organize our references, and divide up the paper into sections for different team members to work on—without causing versioning issues or confusion.

  In the afternoon, we did a quick review of everything we’ve accomplished so far, which was a nice reminder of how far we’ve come. Then, we started training our dataset using the DCAN model. We were also moved to a larger workspace upstairs, which gave us a bit more room to breathe and work comfortably.

  I was quite drained to do anything.

reflection: |
  Today felt a bit dull for me. I had a pretty bad headache, and staring at the code we were working on made it even harder to stay focused. I honestly lost the motivation to do much at some point. Despite that, we still managed to make some progress—we did some research and covered a small part of the training technique. It wasn't a big leap, but it was something, and I'm hopeful that tomorrow will be better.
