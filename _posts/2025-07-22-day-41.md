  Today, we decided to split our tasks to work more efficiently. Kenidee focused on writing the research paper, while Cara and I worked on training two models. Crystal started working on creating a website for our project.

  I trained the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainability tool using our datasets. Before I could do that, I had to carry out a bit more preprocessing. SHAP helped visualize how each feature influenced the predictions in our model, which really supports our goal of explainability. Along the way, I encountered some errors that required adjusting parameters to improve our ROC AUC score and confusion matrix.

  The charts produced by SHAP were also useful—they provided clear evidence that we’re on the right track with our goals: achieving accuracy, interpretability, and fairness (though there's still room for improvement).

  In the afternoon, we did a short workshop on our elevator pitch. We discussed what should be included, how to structure it, and the role each team member will play in the final video.

  It was alot.

  We split up tasks to stay efficient—Kenidee worked on the paper, Crystal started building the website, and Cara and I focused on training two models. I worked on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to help interpret our model’s predictions. After some extra preprocessing and tweaking, I got better ROC AUC scores and useful visualizations that showed we’re on track with our goals.

  In the afternoon, we also practiced for our elevator pitch and assigned roles for the final video. It was a focused and productive day overall.
