what_i_learned: |
  We continued preparing for our mid-summer presentation by finalizing our slides, adding images, and making the layout easier to follow. We also recorded our demo video, which ended up being longer than expected, so we spent time trimming it down to fit the time limit. Afterward, we replayed the video and practiced our presentation multiple times to get more comfortable with the flow.

  One challenge we faced was figuring out how to cut down the amount of information without losing important points. It’s something each of us will need to work on individually to make sure we stay within the timeframe and still communicate clearly. Even with the adjustments and practice rounds, we managed to complete everything we planned. It felt like a good step forward.

  Finalizing the slides and recording our demo video helped bring everything together. Watching the recording made it clear where we needed to cut down and be more concise, which isn’t always easy when there’s a lot to say. Practicing the presentation over and over was tiring, but it showed me what parts I need to work on individually to sound clearer and stay within the time limit. Figuring out what to keep and what to trim is still a work in progress. Still, we got everything we aimed to finish today, and that felt like a solid end to the day.
