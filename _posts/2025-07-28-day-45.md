what_i_learned: |
  This is the final week of CEAMLS SAIRI 2025, and we’re working hard to wrap up our project. Although we haven’t yet achieved the level of accuracy we hoped for, we’re still making improvements and adjusting our models. At the same time, we’ve been finalizing our research paper—it’s almost complete, with just a few sections left to edit and polish, especially the results and conclusion.

  We also continued testing models on our dataset, including new ones like ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 to compare their performance. Despite the challenges, today felt productive and we made solid progress in multiple areas.

  No major blockers today.

reflection: |
  Although we haven’t hit the accuracy we wanted, I’ve come to accept that part of research is working with what you have and improving it step by step. Trying out different models like ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 helped us think more critically about what’s working and what needs to change.

  Finalizing the paper made me reflect on how much we’ve actually accomplished. Even though some parts are still in progress, it feels rewarding to see everything coming together. It’s been a long process, but we’re almost at the finish line.
