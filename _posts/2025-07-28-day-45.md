what_i_learned: |
  This is the final week of CEAMLS SAIRI 2025, and we’re working hard to wrap up our project. Although we haven’t yet achieved the level of accuracy we hoped for, we’re still making improvements and fine-tuning our models. We’ve also been finalizing our research paper—it’s almost done, with just a few sections like the results and conclusion needing final edits and formatting.

  On the modeling side, we experimented with different architectures including ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 to see if they would improve our performance. It was encouraging to see some gains, even if they were small. Overall, it felt like a productive day.

  No major blockers today.

reflection: |
  Even though we didn’t get the accuracy we originally aimed for, I’ve realized that research is all about learning, testing, and refining. Trying out new models like ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 gave us more insight into what works and what doesn’t.

  Working on the final sections of the paper really made me appreciate how far we’ve come. It’s exciting to see everything slowly coming together after weeks of effort. We’re almost there.
