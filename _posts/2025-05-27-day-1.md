what_i_learned: |
  I learned about Git; a version control system, free and open source, and  system to keep track of your changes. I learned about the basic commands in Git and a recorded snapshot of changes called commit. I learned what GitHub is: an online platform with lots of Git repositories. Three main questions were addressed: What happens if you push changes to the same like of code; Do you think the push will succeed if changes are not made on the same line; What happens if two people push changes at the same time.
  
  About commits, I learned that a commit is a pointer to a specific version of a repository; needs a message to describe changes; they are fixed. I also learned about other commands: pull, push, clone, add, status, and log.

  We also played a kahoot game on what we learned on Git and GitHub. It was quite fun and an effective way to revise and point out place I need to study more on. My team won too!

  Not really, maybe just being careful with symbols and links.

reflection: |
  I got to know a lot more about my teammates and colleagues from the bingo game we played. It was a fun and creative way to learn personal things about each other and break the ice. The learning session that followed was made simple and easy to understand, which I really appreciated. It made me feel more encouraged to keep going and dive deeper into the material. Overall, it was a good balance of fun and learning.
