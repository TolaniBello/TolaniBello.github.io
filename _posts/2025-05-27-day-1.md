what_i_learned: |
  I learned about Git; a version control system, free and open source, and  system to keep track of your changes. I learned about the basic commands in Git and a recorded snapshot of changes called commit. I learned what GitHub is: an online platform with lots of Git repositories.

  

blockers: |
  Not really, maybe just being careful with symbols and links.

reflection: |
  It was made simple, easy to understand, and encouraging to move forward and learning more
