  Today, we continued training our model using XGBoost and applied SHAP as an explainable AI tool. We made further adjustments to our dataset, focusing on cleaning and reformatting it to meet the model's input requirements more effectively. We also tweaked several hyperparameters and introduced new ones to improve the model’s accuracy. Key performance metrics like the ROC AUC score and the confusion matrix helped us observe how each change affected the model's output and accuracy. SHAP provided useful visualizations, allowing us to see how each feature contributed to the predictions and helping us maintain transparency in our model.

  Crystal took the lead in editing our elevator pitch video. The final version turned out really well, and I believe it communicates our project clearly and efficiently.

  We’re still experiencing difficulties with training the diagnosis label due to the large number of classes and limited data available for each. Even small changes in the code sometimes disrupt the entire training process.

reflection: |
  Today, I focused primarily on adjusting parameters in both the XGBoost model and SHAP explainability tool to improve our results. Since I already had a good understanding of how both tools work, the process went relatively smoothly. The SHAP visualizations reinforced our model’s performance and aligned well with our goal of building an interpretable and trustworthy AI system.
