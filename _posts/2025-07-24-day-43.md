what_i_learned: |
  Today, we continued working on training our model using XGBoost, and we implemented SHAP for explainability. We cleaned and reformatted more parts of our dataset to better meet the model’s input requirements. I also spent time adjusting and adding hyperparameters to see how they affected model accuracy. We monitored changes in performance using metrics like the ROC AUC score and the confusion matrix, which helped us track the impact of our adjustments.

  SHAP was especially useful today, as it helped us visualize how different features influenced the model’s predictions. This supported our ongoing effort to build a transparent and interpretable AI system. In the afternoon, Crystal worked on editing our 90-second elevator pitch video. After many takes and some trial and error, the final version came out nicely and clearly explained our project.

blockers: |
  We’re still dealing with the challenge of having too many diagnosis classes but limited data for each one. Small code changes sometimes cause disruptions in model training.

reflection: |
  Since I already had a solid understanding of XGBoost and SHAP, applying them today was manageable. The improvements we saw after parameter tuning showed that the model is moving in the right direction. SHAP’s visualizations helped confirm we’re maintaining transparency, and the elevator pitch editing process was a good team moment that brought everything together.
