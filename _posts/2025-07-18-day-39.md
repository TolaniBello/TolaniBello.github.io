what_i_learned: |
  Today was mostly about drafting our methodology and trying to complete the model trainings. Working on the methodology helped us clarify what exactly we want to do, how we plan to do it, and the kind of results we're aiming for. It also pushed me to do deeper research on why the models we chose are suitable for our dataset, what to expect from them, and how to improve their performance.

  We also worked on our weekly presentation report—filling in our slides and recording the video. This week was really productive, even with a few hiccups here and there. It’s also starting to feel real that the program is almost over. I’m really grateful to have come this far. The knowledge I’ve gained is something I’ll carry with me for a long time.

  The We focused on refining our methodology and continued training the models. Writing out the methodology really helped put things into perspective—seeing how everything connects from data collection to model evaluation. It also pushed me to understand more deeply why we’re choosing specific models and how they align with our goals.

  We wrapped up our weekly report by completing the slides and recording our presentation. Looking back, this week felt like a major step forward. Even with the small challenges, we were able to push through. It's hard to believe we’re getting close to the end of this program, but I’m proud of how far we’ve come and excited for what’s still ahead.
