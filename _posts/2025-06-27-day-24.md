what_i_learned: |
  This week finally came to a close, and we were able to go through our code and fix the issues we had been struggling with. It was really fulfilling to spot the errors and get things running the way we wanted—it felt like a solid breakthrough. We also completed our weekly report video today, summarizing the work we’ve done and setting the stage for what’s next.

  I have a feeling next week will be a lot more packed, especially with the mid-summer presentation coming up. Now that our graduate mentor is back from her conference, we’ll likely be diving into new parts of the model and exploring other areas of the project. It feels like things are about to pick up even more from here.

  Today felt like a solid wrap-up to the week. Finally fixing the code we’ve been struggling with was a relief and made the effort from earlier days feel worth it. Seeing it work reminded me how important patience and persistence are in this kind of work. Recording our weekly video helped me reflect on how much we’ve done, even through the setbacks. With our graduate mentor back, I know next week will come with new tasks and probably more intensity, especially with the mid-summer presentation ahead. I’m glad we ended this week on a good note—it gives me a bit more confidence going into what’s next.
