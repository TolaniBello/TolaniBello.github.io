  We started the day with a meeting that included other groups, where we talked through some concerns around mentorship, group dynamics, payments, and the upcoming presentation on Friday. It was necessary, and hearing from others going through similar things made it feel less isolating.

  After the meeting, we got back to training our model, and it quickly became one of those sessions where nothing seemed to go right. Two people joined in to help us troubleshoot, and even with fresh eyes, the issue still wasn’t clear. The code ran, but the output wasn’t what we expected, and we couldn’t pinpoint why. Everyone had theories, but none of them fixed the problem, and it started to wear me out mentally. It's one of those moments where you're doing everything right on paper, but the result just doesn’t match up—and that kind of uncertainty is exhausting.

  There were errors in the code and still couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t working as expected.

  Today felt heavy in a different way. The group meeting helped clear up some important things, but it also reminded me how much is still in motion—between payments, proper communication, and the pressure of the Friday presentation. After that, trying to train our model was frustrating. We spent hours looking at the code, brought in others to help, and still couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t working as expected- We need Blessing ASAP!. It’s draining to keep hitting a wall even when you're doing everything you're supposed to. But I guess that’s part of the process—sitting with the confusion until something clicks.
