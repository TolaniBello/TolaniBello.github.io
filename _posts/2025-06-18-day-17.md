what_i_learned: |
  Today started off a little rough for me since I was late and lost attendance points, which was disappointing. We kicked things off with a fun activity where we had to describe our project without using any of its main keywords—it really made us think creatively about how to communicate our work. Then we did a group challenge where we ranked 15 survival items in order of importance if we were stuck in the ocean with just a life raft, which sparked a lot of interesting conversations. We also got to bond with the high school teacher who will now be joining our research project. One of the fun parts was writing a prompt about our personalities and asking ChatGPT to generate people who would thrive around us.

  In the afternoon, we sat down with the teacher to talk more about our project—what it’s about, the problem we’re addressing, and how we plan to go about it. He shared some insight into cancer, how it develops, and how chemotherapy works, which added useful context to our research. We also read two articles, one explaining max pooling and the other about convolutions, both key parts of understanding how deep learning models work. By the end of the day, I was definitely feeling ready to log off. I’m especially glad we have a holiday tomorrow for Juneteenth—looking forward to the break.

  I got points off my attendance because I came late!

reflection: |
  Today had a mix of ups and downs. I was late and lost attendance points, which wasn’t the best way to start, but the rest of the day turned out meaningful. The activity where we described our project without using key terms challenged me to think more creatively about how to communicate our work. I also enjoyed bonding with the high school teacher who’s joining our research—it made the project feel more collaborative. Talking with him about cancer and chemotherapy gave more depth to what we’re studying. Reading about max pooling and convolutions helped me connect more pieces of the technical side. I’m definitely ready for the Juneteenth break tomorrow—it’s well-timed and much needed.
