what_i_learned: |
  I learned a lot more about python programming language. I learned about python syntax, how to write a comment, different variable types; variable names are case sensitive; different types of case a variable could be written in.

  I learned some more about data types and we had some interactive teaching in class from each group member. I spoke about modifying strings and I learned from my colleagues, how to write a comment, how to change data types, and looping a list or a string.

  I was also able to see many more commands that can be utilized in python which I think is a lot and cannot be known fully in one day. I learned about the differences and similarities between list, tuple, serpts, and dictionary. I took some exercises on each category I learned about today to ensure that I have a good understanding of what was learned or practiced.

  

blockers: |
  No blockers today, it was pretty much a bit more of what we did last week.

reflection: |
  Today was a little tiring because I spent a lot of time on my laptop learning about python but, I can boldly say that I have added to my streak on learning python and I am not a bit discouraged to learn more. Learning the commands can be sort of tiring because it is a lot but I guess will learn them as I work on some projects.
