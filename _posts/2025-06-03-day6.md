what_i_learned: |
  I learned a lot more about python programming language. I learned about python syntax, how to write a comment, different variable types; variable names are case sensitive; different types of case a variable could be written in.

  I learned some more about data types and we had some interactive teaching in class from each group member. I spoke about modifying strings and I learned from my colleagues, how to write a comment, how to change data types, and looping a list or a string.

  I was also able to see many more commands that can be utilized in python which I think is a lot and cannot be known fully in one day. I learned about the differences and similarities between list, tuple, serpts, and dictionary. I took some exercises on each category I learned about today to ensure that I have a good understanding of what was learned or practiced.

  

blockers: |
  No blockers today, it was pretty much a bit more of what we did last week.

reflection: |
  Today was a little tiring because I spent a lot of time on my laptop learning Python, but I can boldly say that I’ve added to my learning streak. I’m proud of the progress I’m making and not at all discouraged to keep going. Learning all the different commands can feel like a lot sometimes, especially when you're just starting out. But I believe that with practice and by working on real projects, they’ll start to stick naturally. I’m still very motivated and looking forward to improving even more.
