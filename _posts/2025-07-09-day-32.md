what_i_learned: |
  We continued working on our project code, this time using the XGBoost model to train our dataset. There was a small issue with encoding the columns properly, but we managed to work through it without too much delay. After sorting that out, we were able to successfully train the model. The classification report showed that the model performed well, and seeing that reflected in the matrix gave a better sense of how it’s handling the data. It felt like a productive step forward, especially as we try out different approaches to improve performance.

  No blockers.

  Getting the XGBoost model to work today felt like a solid step. Even though we ran into a small issue with column encoding, it didn’t hold us back for long. Seeing the model train successfully and getting a good accuracy score in the classification report was reassuring. It helped me feel more confident about trying out different models and comparing results. The process is still trial and error, but moments like this show that we're moving in the right direction.
