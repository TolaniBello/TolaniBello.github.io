what_i_learned: |
  We started today by watching tutorials on how to create, compile, and train a deep learning model. The videos also helped break down key terms we need to understand when building or training a model, such as activation function, loss function, optimizer, artificial neural network (ANN), layers of ANN, learning rate, and epoch. Even though we only made it through 8 out of the 38 videos, the discussions helped clarify a lot of concepts. It was a bit technical at times, but definitely eye-opening and useful for what we’re trying to build.

  In the afternoon, we shifted gears and focused on drafting our abstract. We began by outlining the key components that needed to be included, then filled it in step by step until we had a complete first draft. It's still open to edits and improvements, but it felt good to have a solid starting point. We followed a similar process for our introduction, carefully piecing it together based on what we’ve learned and what our project is aiming to address. I must say, a lot was achieved today, and it feels like everything is starting to take shape.

  We spent today learning about deep learning models through tutorial videos. Although we only got through 8 out of 38, the breakdown of terms like activation function, loss function, optimizer, and learning rate helped clear up some confusion. Discussing the material as a group also made it easier to follow. In the afternoon, we worked on drafting our abstract and introduction. We started with a rough outline and built it out section by section until we had a full draft. It was a focused day, and we moved a few important tasks forward.
