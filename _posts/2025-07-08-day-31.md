  Rewatching our presentation video was definitely a little cringe, but it’s chill—I get why it’s necessary. It helped point out parts that could be better, especially how we explain certain things. I’m glad we also took time to reflect on the feedback and started working through the questions and suggestions we received. Finding some datasets today felt like progress, even if most didn’t include the Fitzpatrick scale like we hoped. Using the ITA instead is definitely going to take extra work, but it feels like the best next step. We’ll pull through—it’s just one of those things we have to figure out as we go.

  No blockers.

  Working with the XGBoost Classifier today gave me a different perspective on model training, and it was helpful to step away from our usual workflow for a bit. Trying out the binary classification approach also made me think more about how we structure our labels and what that means for accuracy and fairness. We’re still in the process of finding solid datasets, which can be a little repetitive, but it’s necessary. The balance between researching and coding kept the day moving, and even though there’s still more to refine, it felt like we explored something useful. It’s one of those days that adds depth to the bigger picture of the project.
