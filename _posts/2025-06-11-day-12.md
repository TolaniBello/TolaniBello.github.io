what_i_learned: |
  Today was very much rewarding, and a lot of progress was made. After shuffling around this morning to find a good place to settle down and get started with our project, we jumped into our tasks for the day. We did some literature reviews, and they were quite detailed and easy to understand, which made the process smoother. It was encouraging to find research that directly connects to the focus of our project.

  We also found new datasets and checked to make sure they accounted for what we needed—specifically, fair and dark skin bias. Using what we've been learning in Python, we located specific columns in the dataset to see if different skin tones were properly represented. After the lunch break, we started merging the datasets by identifying similar columns and aligning them to fit our research goals. It felt good to apply what we've learned in a real and meaningful way.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  Today, it felt good to see everything we’ve learned so far being put into action. Applying our Python skills to check for fairness in the dataset and merging data made things come together in a real way. It was motivating to finally see the connection between what we’ve been learning and the actual work.
  We also had a reflection session to talk about our progress in the program, which was a nice pause to appreciate how far we’ve come. I’m grateful to our graduate mentor, Blessing, for leading that—it helped me more aware of what we’ve done so far.
