what_i_learned: |
  I wasn’t feeling too well today, so I took a break to rest. I had initially planned to return after lunch, but the pain didn’t ease up, and my graduate mentor advised me to stay home and get proper rest. I’m glad I listened because the rest was definitely needed. While resting, I took some time to check in on our project progress. I saw that the datasets have been merged, and we’re still working on training the models. We're also making progress on drafting the methodology section of our research paper, so things are still moving forward.

  No blockers.

  Taking today off to rest was needed, even though I had hoped to push through and return after lunch. It was reassuring to have my graduate mentor’s support in prioritizing my health. While resting, I still kept up with our project updates and checked on how far we’ve come. Seeing that the datasets are fully merged and model training is ongoing gave me some peace of mind. We’re also making headway on the methodology section of our paper, which feels like another important step. Even though I wasn’t physically present, I still felt connected to the work and the progress we’re making.
