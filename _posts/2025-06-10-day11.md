  Today, we continued working with Pandas and took things a step further by drafting graphs to find correlations within our dataset. It was interesting to visualize the data and see patterns more clearly. I noticed there was a stronger correlation between age and diagnosis, which might be useful for our research later on. We also learned how to merge two datasets by using their file paths along with the os.path function, which is a useful tool when working with multiple data sources. Although it was a bit tricky at first, practicing with real examples helped it make more sense. It’s starting to feel rewarding to see the pieces come together.

  We played two Kahoot games today to help review everything we’ve been learning about machine learning since last Friday. I actually won one of the games, which made me feel good and showed me I’ve been picking up the material pretty well. In addition to the games, we completed two literature reviews each and searched for datasets and metadata that would help bring more diversity into our project. I was able to find a few good resources and felt especially encouraged by one article I found. The researchers in that paper developed or used a model called PamDerm, which I think could relate well to what we’re trying to do. Overall, it was a productive and encouraging day.

  Not really, just some information to absorb and play around with.

reflection: |
  Today was very much productive and enjoyable. Playing Kahoot was a fun way to review everything we’ve been learning about machine learning, and it helped me realize how much I’ve actually retained. It brought some excitement into the day and gave a nice break from the more technical tasks. I was also really glad we did the literature review today because I came across some interesting research that might be helpful for our project. It was exciting to see how other researchers are approaching similar problems and to discover models like PamDerm that could inspire or support our work. Overall, it felt like a good balance of learning, reviewing, and exploring new ideas.
