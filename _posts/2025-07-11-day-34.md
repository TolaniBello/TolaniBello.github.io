what_i_learned: |
  This morning, we started by preprocessing the datasets and merging the cleaned datasets we each worked on into one Google Colab notebook. We completed the merge and successfully saved the final version to our drive, which felt like a solid step forward.

  After that, we filled out our weekly report presentation slides and recorded the video. We continued refining our code, and I also took some time to update my resume. Each of us was assigned a model architecture to research for our upcoming implementation. I focused on DCAN, Cara worked on Grad-CAM, and Kenidee looked into SHAP. It helped set a foundation for understanding the explainability tools we'll be applying.

reflection: |
  Today was fulfilling—happy to have gone this far and knowing there’s still more to come. Merging the datasets into one notebook felt like a big step forward, and seeing our individual work come together was a good reminder of the progress we've made. Recording the weekly video also gave us space to reflect on everything we've done this week. Updating my resume made me realize how much I’ve learned in just a short time. Researching model architectures like DCAN helped me understand the importance of explainability in our project. Overall, it feels like we’re building toward something meaningful, and I’m looking forward to what’s next.
