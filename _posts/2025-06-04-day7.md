what_i_learned: |
  I deepened my understanding of Python, particularly how to work with lists and tuples. I learned how to add, remove, and clear elements in both data structures, which helped me grasp how data can be managed efficiently in different scenarios. The session made me appreciate the differences between lists and tuples—especially the mutability of lists versus the fixed nature of tuples. Practicing these operations in real-time really boosted my confidence in writing cleaner, more effective code. It’s exciting to see how foundational concepts like these tie directly into real-world data processing. 

  We started the day with an icebreaker—“Two Truths and a Lie”—which turned out to be fun. Everyone participated enthusiastically, and it gave us a lighthearted way to learn about one another. It helped break down any awkwardness, not like there was any anyways, and made the group feel more connected. I feel like I now know a bit more about the people I’ll be working closely with this summer, which makes the whole experience feel more collaborative.

  We also had an in-depth discussion about our research project. I shared my problem statement and walked through the approach or methods we plan to use. We discussed what makes our project “trustworthy,” especially in terms of fairness, explainability, and the use of open-source datasets. Additionally, we outlined some realistic milestones for the first four weeks, which helps me visualize how to pace the work ahead. It was helpful to also talk through the type of support we might need throughout the project—whether technical, mentorship, or access to resources.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today was really engaging and surprisingly fun. I liked how we mixed learning with group conversations—it made everything feel more natural and less overwhelming. Talking through the project with everyone helped clear up some things I was unsure about. I’m feeling more confident and genuinely excited to keep going with the work ahead.
