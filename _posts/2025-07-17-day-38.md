what_i_learned: |
  We had another writing workshop with Dr. Anita today—she’s honestly so interesting and really knows her stuff. We learned more about how to structure a research paper, especially the methodology section—breaking it down clearly step by step. She also walked us through how to write a proper literature review in IEEE format and what essential elements need to be addressed in it.

  Later on, we took some time to go over the codes we’ve been working on throughout the week, just to make sure everything made sense and we weren’t missing any important details. It was a helpful refresher. And to top it all off, our high school teacher treated us to lunch at Baltimore Seafood Boil. Really grateful for that—definitely a good way to end.

reflection: |
  We had another session with Dr. Anita where we learned even more about scientific writing. She helped us better understand how to approach the methodology section—breaking it down in a way that’s clear and step-by-step. We also discussed how to write a solid literature review using the IEEE format and what should be included to make it effective.

  After that, we reviewed our code again to make sure we truly understand what we’ve been building and that nothing important was left out. It was a helpful checkpoint. Our high school teacher also took us out for lunch at Baltimore Seafood Boil, which was really thoughtful and a nice break in the day.
