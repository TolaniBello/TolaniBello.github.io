what_i_learned: |
  We had another writing workshop with Dr. Anita—she’s genuinely engaging and clearly knows her field. We learned more about structuring a research paper, especially the methodology section—how to break it down clearly, step by step. She also guided us through writing a literature review in IEEE format, explaining the key components that need to be addressed.

  Later, we reviewed the code we’ve been working on throughout the week to ensure everything made sense and that we hadn’t missed any important steps. It was a helpful refresher. To end the day, our high school teacher treated us to lunch at Baltimore Seafood Boil, which we all really appreciated.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today’s session with Dr. Anita helped deepen our understanding of scientific writing. Her breakdown of the methodology section and guidance on the IEEE-style literature review made the writing process feel more manageable and clear.

  Going back through our code was also useful—it gave us a chance to reconnect with what we’ve built and double-check our logic. Ending the day with lunch at Baltimore Seafood Boil was a kind gesture and a nice way to pause and appreciate how far we’ve come.
