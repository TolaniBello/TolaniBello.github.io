what_i_learned: |
  I spent some time researching extra courses that could help boost my analysis skills and deepen my understanding of deep learning, especially in connection to biology-related careers. I looked into what types of courses would be most useful, when to take them, and where they’re offered. It felt helpful to think ahead and explore ways to build a stronger foundation beyond the current program.

  I also continued watching the deep learning tutorial videos and learned about concepts like zero padding, max pooling, and the different types of padding—valid and same. I found it interesting that using filters reduces the dimensions of the output, and padding is used to correct that so important data isn't lost. The way these techniques are applied to preserve features in images made a lot more sense after today’s session.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  Today was a thoughtful and steady day. Researching additional courses helped me feel more prepared for what comes after this program, especially in applying deep learning to biology. The tutorial videos also added more clarity to concepts like padding and max pooling, and I’m starting to see how they fit into what we’re building. It was helpful to take a step back and focus on understanding the tools better. Still, I’m really looking forward to continuing with the main code tomorrow, especially with our graduate mentor, Blessing. I’m hoping we can finally figure out what’s been going wrong and how to clean it up for better results.
