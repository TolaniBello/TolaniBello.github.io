what_i_learned: |
  Today, we worked on completing our final presentation slides and compiling the results of our model and research. Blessing also continued training the model to finalize performance outputs.

  Later, we assigned presentation roles to each team member, and I worked on designing and refining the layout of the slides.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It feels good to see everything coming together after weeks of work. Finalizing the slides and assigning roles made it clear how far weâ€™ve come as a team. Although there are still small tasks to wrap up, I feel more confident about presenting our research and results.
