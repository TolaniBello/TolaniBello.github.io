what_i_learned: |
  I learned about machine learning and how deep learning is a more intricate and advanced branch within the broader field of machine learning. I explored the main categories of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, reinforced, and self-supervised learning, among others. I also learned about different learning models such as CNN, GAN, DCAN, and the diffusion model. We researched each of these models to better understand their structures, functions, and how they could be applied to our research project. This knowledge helped us identify which models may be most suitable and effective for the goals of our work.

  We created a slide presentation outlining how our week was supposed to go, what we accomplished, the challenges we faced, and what to expect or plan for next week. Each section of the presentation was carefully organized to reflect our weekly progress and experiences. We included details about our tasks, any obstacles we encountered, and how we addressed them. The presentation also highlighted our goals and upcoming steps for the following week. Finally, we presented and recorded these slides as part of the SAIRI weekly video report.

  Not really, just had a lot of information to absorb on machine learning.

reflection: |
  This week in general was really engaging and full of learning. We made a slide presentation about how our week went, the challenges we faced, and what we plan to do next—then recorded it for our SAIRI weekly report. I learned more about machine learning, especially how deep learning is a more advanced part of it. We covered different types like supervised, unsupervised, reinforced, and self-supervised learning. I also got introduced to models like CNN, GAN, DCAN, and diffusion models, and how they might help with our research. To wrap up the day, we did a fun Kahoot on Python, which helped reinforce what we’ve been learning in a lighthearted way.
