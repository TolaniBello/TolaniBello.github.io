what_i_learned: |
  We made strong progress by fixing all the errors in our code today and moving forward with the next steps. We successfully resolved the image paths and parsed the images, which felt like a big step forward after the earlier setbacks. As a group, we took time to talk through the code—what we’ve done so far, where to focus next, and what to expect as we continue building.

  We also reviewed our presentation slides and made some edits after looking at a sample from last year, which gave us better direction. Going through all these steps has definitely helped me understand the process more clearly. At this point, I feel confident explaining how to create the model, what it should produce, and the terms involved.

  No blockers!

  Today went well and helped me feel more grounded in what we’re doing. Fixing the errors in our code and finally getting the images to parse properly was a huge relief—it felt like a weight off our shoulders. Talking through the code with the group gave some clarity on what we’ve done so far and what still needs attention. Looking at last year’s presentation example helped us tighten up our own slides, which made a big difference. I can now explain how the model works without second-guessing myself, and that’s a nice shift from how things felt just a week ago. It’s starting to feel like we’re really getting somewhere.
