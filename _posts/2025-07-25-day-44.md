what_i_learned: |
  We learned about robotics from Dr. Chris Crawford in the morning. He explained how the brain communicates with machines and when the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) was first used. He showed several of his projects—from building a device that detects when the tongue sticks out, to using muscle signals and brain electrical impulses to control robots and even fly a drone. It made me realize how possible these technologies are, and how close we are to what we see in sci-fi movies.

  In the afternoon, Blessing did additional cleaning on the dataset by removing unnecessary values. I also ran the cleaned data through the models to check if the accuracy would improve. It did increase slightly. Overall, today was productive, and we didn’t have to make a weekly video since we already completed the 90-second elevator pitch.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today. Just working through some small improvements to the dataset and model performance.

reflection: |
  Today was both inspiring and productive. Dr. Crawford’s talk showed me what’s possible with robotics and brain-machine interfaces. It was fascinating to see real-world applications of technology that once seemed futuristic. On the project side, it felt good to see our model improve slightly after some data cleaning. We’re making steady progress.
