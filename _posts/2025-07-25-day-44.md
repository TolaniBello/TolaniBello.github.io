what_i_learned: |
  We had a session with Dr. Chris Crawford in the morning where he introduced us to robotics and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). He explained how machines and the human brain communicate and walked us through several of his projects, including controlling a robot using muscle signals and flying a drone using only brain impulses. It gave me a deeper understanding of how BCIs work and how close we are to merging neuroscience with real-world tech applications.

  In the afternoon, Blessing continued cleaning the dataset by removing more unnecessary values. I also ran the updated dataset through our models to see if it would improve accuracy—it did improve slightly. Since we completed our 90-second pitch, we didn’t need to do a weekly video today.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today, but it was still a bit tricky navigating the limited data available for some diagnosis classes.

reflection: |
  Dr. Crawford’s talk was really insightful—it helped me realize how much progress is being made in brain-machine communication. It was inspiring to see real-life examples of technology we often think only exists in movies. On the project side, the slight improvement in our model’s accuracy after data cleaning showed that the little things really do add up. Today felt meaningful and productive.
