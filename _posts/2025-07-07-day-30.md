what_i_learned: |
  In the morning, we had an issue with our class, but it was settled and we got moved to a different one. We rewatched our presentation to pick out areas that need improvement and took note of what we could adjust. After that, we made plans on what to include or consider as we move forward with the project and jotted down some ideas. We also reviewed the questions and suggestions we received during our Thursday presentation and worked on finding solutions to them.

  We spent some time reviewing literature to find datasets that represent all skin tones to help make our model more robust. Most of what we found didn’t include the Fitzpatrick scale, which makes things a bit limiting. So now, we’re considering using the ITA (Individual Typology Angle) as an alternative. It’s not a perfect fix, but it might give us a better way to account for skin tone variation in the data.

reflection: |
  Rewatching our presentation video was definitely a little cringe, but it’s chill—I get why it’s necessary. It helped point out parts that could be better, especially how we explain certain things. I’m glad we also took time to reflect on the feedback and started working through the questions and suggestions we received. Finding some datasets today felt like progress, even if most didn’t include the Fitzpatrick scale like we hoped. Using the ITA instead is definitely going to take extra work, but it feels like the best next step. We’ll pull through—it’s just one of those things we have to figure out as we go.
