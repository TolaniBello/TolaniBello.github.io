what_i_learned: |
  I learned about Git; a version control system, free and open source, and  system to keep track of your changes. I learned about the basic commands in Git and a recorded snapshot of changes called commit. I learned what GitHub is: an online platform with lots of Git repositories. Three main questions were addressed: What happens if you push changes to the same like of code; Do you think the push will succeed if changes are not made on the same line; What happens if two people push changes at the same time.
  
  About commits, I learned that a commit is a pointer to a specific version of a repository; needs a message to describe changes; they are fixed. I also learned about other commands: pull, push, clone, add, status, and log.

  We also played a kahoot game on what we learned on Git and GitHub. It was quite fun and an effective way to revise and point out place I need to study more on. My team won too!

  Not really, maybe just being careful with symbols and links.

reflection: |
  I got to know a lot more about my team mates and colleagues from the bingo game we played. The learning session was made simple, easy to understand, and encouraging to move forward and learning more.
