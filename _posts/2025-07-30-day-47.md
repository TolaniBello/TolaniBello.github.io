what_i_learned: |
  Today, we finalized our slide presentation, recorded the demo video, and practiced our roles for presenting. We also saved our trained models and made some final adjustments to ensure all necessary information was included.

  Blessing continued working on the website, and we’re hoping it will be completed by the end of the day.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Wrapping up the presentation and demo video today made everything feel more real. Practicing our parts helped build confidence and made us more aware of how well we understood the project. Finalizing the models and content made me reflect on how much progress we’ve made from the beginning.

  It’s been a lot of work, but seeing the full presentation come together was rewarding. I’m also glad we could split tasks like website development and presentation design to stay efficient and focused.
