what_i_learned: |
  Today, we started by reviewing our code from the last session to make sure everything was still in place. We then moved on to splitting our dataset based on the percentage distribution of each skin tone category—40%, 30%, and 30%. After that, we separated the split data from the rest of the dataset and saved both parts. We also completed our weekly report, highlighting what we accomplished this week and setting clear goals for next week.

  Later, we continued working on building our model, resolving paths, and parsing the data. This part took quite a bit of time because we had to debug several errors to get the code running properly. It was a bit draining at times, but it helped us understand the workflow more clearly. This week overall has been packed with activities and tasks, but we managed to make steady progress.



blockers: |
  One blocker today was figuring out why the code wouldn’t run. The errors weren’t clear, and we spent a lot of time going through the code to find the issues. Most were small things like typos or wrong paths, but they caused big delays. It was frustrating, but it helped us pay more attention to detail.

reflection: |
  Today was mostly focused on refining our code and pushing forward with our model setup. We spent a lot of time debugging and fixing errors, which got pretty frustrating after a while. The issues weren’t always obvious, so it took a lot of patience and backtracking to get things running properly. At some point, I realized how tiring it can get when you're writing and correcting code non-stop. You’ll think you don’t need rest until you try to move forward and your brain just can’t process anymore. Still, we pushed through and made real progress—great and fulfilling week, I must say.
