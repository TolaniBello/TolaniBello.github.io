what_i_learned: |
  For today, we learned how to use Pandas (Panel Data or Python Data Analysis), and it was a very productive session. We explored different functions such as creating dataframes, reading CSV files, cleaning data, handling empty cells, counting null or missing data, and generating graphs from the datasets. These tools are essential for organizing and analyzing large amounts of data efficiently, especially in research. We practiced using a dataset we created ourselves and also worked with one of the datasets allocated for our ongoing research project. It was interesting to see how simple lines of code could transform raw data into something more structured and meaningful. Overall, the hands-on experience made the learning process more engaging and relatable.

  Although it was fun to create and write these codes to get the expected results and graphs, it was a bit tiring after a while. The continuous addition of lines of code took some getting used to, especially when trying to keep track of each function and its effect on the dataset. I realized I will definitely need more time to go over everything we learned today so it can fully stick. Despite the fatigue, it felt rewarding to see the output match what we had planned or expected. It gave me more confidence to keep learning and improving in data analysis. I'm excited to continue building on these skills as we move forward in our research.

  Not really, just had a lot of information to absorb.

reflection: |
  Today was a bit slower for me, mostly because it was quite hot and that made it harder to focus at times. Despite that, I was able to stay productive and get through the tasks we had planned. Reading the feedback on our weekly report video from last week was really helpful—it gave me a few pointers on things to improve and keep in mind as we continue working on the project. I also took time to watch videos from other groups and left comments, especially on the ones using similar models to ours. It was interesting to see how others are approaching their projects and what strategies they’re using. Overall, even though the heat slowed me down a bit, I still managed to learn and reflect, which made the day worthwhile.
