what_i_learned: |
  I learned about computer vision; defined as how computers see and interprete images and vides how humans do. There are four main task that computer vision can do: Image classification, Object detection, Object tracking, and Image segmentation.

  I learned how the Computer Vision works: seeing with the camera, then break down images, then finding objects and patterns, use of bounding boxes, generate kearning example. We used a website called Teachable Machine powered by google to see how it works. Examples where computer vision is applied are facial recognition, self driving cars, security and surveillance. 

  We also made use of a coding library, specifically YOLO on google colab to perform the computer vision using codes.

  We continued with the python class today, I learned about I/O
