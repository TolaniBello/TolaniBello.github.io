what_i_learned: |
  I learned about computer vision; defined as how computers see and interprete images and vides how humans do. There are four main task that computer vision can do: Image classification, Object detection, Object tracking, and Image segmentation.

  I learned how the Computer Vision works: seeing with the camera, then break down images, then finding objects and patterns, use of bounding boxes, generate kearning example. We used a website called Teachable Machine powered by google to see how it works. Examples where computer vision is applied are facial recognition, self driving cars, security and surveillance. 

  We also made use of a coding library, specifically YOLO on google colab to perform the computer vision using codes.

  We continued with the python class today, I learned about I/O, the interaction between a computer program and a user. I did some examples and did not run into any error. Being in the Python 102 class actually gave me a clear headspace of what I did in Python 101.

blockers: |
  I was first of place in the Python 102 class and after two exercises today, I realized that I was lacking in some basic knowledge of python, and so I was moved to the 101 class. It is quite slower than I want it but, I think it is best for me.


reflection: |
  Overall, today was good. I am starting to get used to the work and time balance for this program and it is far better and less stressful to commit to. I think that computer vision is an interesting area to explore. We also played a game called escape room and it was quite frustrating to have so many clues and still not figure out how to break out.
