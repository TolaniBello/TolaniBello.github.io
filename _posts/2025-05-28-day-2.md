what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about the Python programming language today, especially how to create and work with sets and dictionaries. I now understand how to add items and change values in a dictionary, which is a big step forward for me. I also found it interesting that different types of brackets are used for certain commands, like when creating an empty set. 
  
  On the fun side, I was introduced to a new game called Headband (or Hedbanz), which I really enjoyed. It showed me how important it is to pay attention, think quickly, and stay focused when solving problems.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It just shows me that I have so much more to learn, and I’m genuinely happy and excited about that. Today reminded me to stay open-minded because you really can learn or do anything if you put in the effort. I also got to learn a little more about the project I’ll be working on this summer, which makes everything feel more real and exciting. On top of that, I made a lot more progress on creating my website, which felt really rewarding. It’s been a productive and inspiring day overall.
