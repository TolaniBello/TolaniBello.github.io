what_i_learned: |
  I learned about python programming language more, I learned about how to create a set and a dictionary, how to add items and change values in my dictionary, there is also different brackets for commands to use an empty set. 

  I learned about a new game-Headband or hedbanz, it was quite fun to see how much it is important to pay attention and think fast to resolve an issue.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I just shows me that I have more to learn and I am happy to learn. Today has made me more open minded that you can learn or do anything. I also got to know a little bit on the project I would be working on for the summer. I also made a lot more progress in creating my website.
