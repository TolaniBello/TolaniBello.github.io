what_i_learned: |
  Today, I applied what I’ve been learning in Python by creating a contact book using a dictionary, defining a function, using if-else statements, and the not function. It felt really good to see how all these concepts could come together to build something functional. There were definitely some frustrating moments, especially when I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with certain lines of code. But working through those issues made the process even more rewarding. Overall, it was a fulfilling experience that showed me how much I’m growing.

  We had a tour of most parts of Morgan State University today, and although it was quite stressful walking that much, it turned out to be a good experience. I had the chance to talk to more people and learn a bit about some of my colleagues, which made the day more enjoyable. Even though I don’t quite remember how to get to all the buildings, I’m glad I got my steps in and had the chance to socialize a little. One thing that really stood out to me was how artistic and beautifully designed the buildings are. I love creative spaces, and Morgan State definitely has that vibe.

  Not really, except navigating what the problem was in the code and correcting it. The AI that underlines the incorrect code helped though.

reflection: |
  Today was a bit exhausting, especially with all the walking during the campus tour and even after because I do not have a car so, I had to walk a lot today— it was quite hot outside, which made it even more draining. Still, I appreciated the chance to explore more of Morgan State University and see how beautiful and creatively designed the buildings are. I also got to talk to more of my colleagues, which helped me feel a bit more connected socially. On the technical side, working on my Python contact book was both challenging and fulfilling. Even though I ran into a few frustrating bugs, it felt great to apply what I’ve been learning and actually build something that works.
