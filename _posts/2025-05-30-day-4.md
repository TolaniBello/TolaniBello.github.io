what_i_learned: |
  Starting with the python program, We learned more about computer making decisions using condition statements or algorithm, the boolean data type, and logical operators. I learned to make a grade book and I found it interesting because I get to see firsthand and even create exactly how grades can be converted to a letter grade and comments. Clyde Tandjong taught about Gen AI and LLMs. 
  
  Gen AI is an AI that can create or generate new content such as images, audio, video, etc. Examples include ChatGPT, Elevenlabs, GitHub Copilot. Evolution of Gen AI- ML- Deep Learning- Gen AI. I learned about the unique features of these evolution and examples too. We had a class activity to use Character AI, Suno AI, and Elevenlabs to create something- it was fun and very much engaging.
  
  In LLMs, I learned that they are Large Language Models that use deep learning algorithm that makes use of neural networks to process and understand human languages. I learned about the different common examples of LLMs and how they work: Tokenization, Embeddings, Predicting, Prompt engineering, and the techniques involved in each step.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I learned about a lot of things today, and I’m really grateful to be part of this program. It’s eye-opening to see how AI connects so closely to our everyday lives as humans. I now feel more comfortable with Python and the progress I’ve made so far. It’s encouraging to see how much I’ve grown, and I’m motivated to keep practicing. I definitely look forward to exploring more advanced parts of the language as we go.
