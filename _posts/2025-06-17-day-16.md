what_i_learned: |
  Today, we continued working on our main coding project, focusing on refining and filling in different parts of the code. The merging of datasets was explained clearly by our graduate mentor, Blessing, which helped clear up a lot of the confusion we had before. That explanation really made the process easier to follow and apply.

  Later, we did a mini project to test what we’ve learned so far. I created a concatenated dataset of patients from different hospitals, and it actually worked successfully. The task was a bit repetitive and even a little frustrating at times, but it really helped me retain the information. It pushed me to research more Python functions and reminded me of things I had forgotten. I’d honestly do something like this again—today made me realize just how true "practice makes perfect" can be.

reflection: |
  Today gave me a better grasp of the work we’ve been doing, especially with merging datasets. Blessing’s explanation helped simplify what had felt confusing before, and it made applying it in our main project more straightforward. The mini project we did afterward was helpful, even though it felt repetitive at times. Creating a concatenated dataset gave me a chance to apply what I’ve learned and figure things out through trial and error. It also pushed me to look up a few Python functions on my own, which helped solidify my understanding. Overall, it reminded me that the more I practice, the more confident I become.
