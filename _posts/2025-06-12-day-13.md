what_i_learned: |
  We started this morning with the CEAMLS SAIRI cohort, where each group shared what we’ve done in our research so far. It was great hearing everyone's progress and reflecting on how far we've come. We also had some fun playing games—my team lost the Jenga game but made a major comeback by winning the Taboo game, which was a highlight of the day. Later on, we were introduced to Overleaf and how to use it. It was pretty straightforward since we worked from a template and just needed to understand how to upload and organize our content.

  In the afternoon, we got back to working on our datasets. We cleaned them, renamed some columns, and began mapping things out before merging. We also came up with a clear process to follow, which made the task feel more manageable. It was a good mix of learning, teamwork, and progress today.

reflection: |
  Today was a good balance of learning, fun, and progress. Starting the day with the CEAMLS SAIRI group presentations helped me reflect on how much work we’ve done so far and where we’re headed. The games added a fun break—losing Jenga stung a little, but winning Taboo made up for it and brought some great energy to the day. Learning to use Overleaf was surprisingly smooth, and it was helpful to work with a template that made everything feel more doable. In the afternoon, cleaning and mapping our datasets felt productive, especially since we came up with a clear process to guide us through merging. Overall, it was a fulfilling day, and I’m proud of the progress we’re making.
