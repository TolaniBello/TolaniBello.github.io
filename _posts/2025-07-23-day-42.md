what_i_learned: |
  Today, we trained our model using XGBoost and implemented SHAP as an explainable AI tool. We had to make additional adjustments to our dataset, such as cleaning and reformatting it to match the model's input requirements. We also tweaked several hyperparameters to improve the model’s accuracy and performance metrics like ROC AUC score and confusion matrix. SHAP helped us visualize how each feature contributed to the model’s predictions, making our results more interpretable and aligned with our goal of building a transparent AI system.

  Later in the day, we recorded our 90-second elevator pitch video. It took several takes to finalize, and I took way many takes to finally get it right. This exercise helped us organize our core ideas and communicate our project clearly and confidently.

  We had problem with training the diagnosis because it had a lot of class and less data to train on.

reflection: |
  Today was productive. I focused on training our model using XGBoost and the SHAP explainability tool. I already had a good understanding of how both work, so applying them went smoothly. The visualizations from SHAP helped reinforce the performance and interpretability of our model, especially in relation to our project goals. Recording the elevator pitch was a fun team activity—it took a few tries, but we managed to put everything together well in the end.
