what_i_learned: |
  Today, we trained our model using XGBoost and implemented SHAP as an explainable AI tool. We made additional adjustments to our dataset, including cleaning and reformatting it to fit the model's input requirements. We also tweaked several hyperparameters to improve the model’s accuracy and key metrics like the ROC AUC score and confusion matrix. SHAP helped us visualize how each feature contributed to the model’s predictions, making our results more interpretable and aligned with our goal of building a transparent AI system.

  Later in the day, we recorded our 90-second elevator pitch video. It took several takes to finalize, and I had to redo my part a few times to get it right. This exercise helped us clarify our core ideas and present our project clearly and confidently.

  We had issues training the diagnosis label because it includes many classes but limited data per class.

reflection: |
  Today was productive. I focused on training our model using XGBoost and the SHAP explainability tool. Since I already understood how both tools work, applying them went smoothly. The SHAP visualizations helped confirm our model’s performance and supported our goal of interpretability. Recording the elevator pitch was also a good team experience—it took a few tries, but we pulled it together well.
