  Today, we trained our model using XGBoost and implemented SHAP as an explainable AI tool. We made additional adjustments to the dataset, such as cleaning and reformatting it to meet the model's input requirements. We also fine-tuned several hyperparameters to improve the model’s accuracy and performance metrics, including the ROC AUC score and the confusion matrix. SHAP provided clear visualizations that showed how each feature influenced the model’s predictions, which supported our goal of building a more transparent and interpretable AI system.

  Later in the day, we recorded our 90-second elevator pitch video. It took multiple takes to finalize, and I personally needed several tries to get mine right. This exercise helped us refine our key points and communicate the essence of our project clearly and confidently.

  We had issues training the diagnosis model due to the high number of classes and limited data available for each class.

reflection: |
  Today was productive. I focused on training our model using XGBoost and the SHAP explainability tool. Since I already had experience working with both, applying them was straightforward. The SHAP visualizations helped reinforce the model’s performance and interpretability. Recording the elevator pitch was a good team effort—it took a few tries, but we got it done successfully.
