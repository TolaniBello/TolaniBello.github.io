  For our CEAMLS cohort today, we had a session with Professor Anita Pandey and her team from Morgan State University’s Writing Center. She gave us a brief but helpful lesson on writing tips and broke down the different types of English used in communication. She also walked us through the structure of a research paper, especially the abstract—highlighting sections like background/context, research gap, methods, results, and implication. One thing that stuck with me was her point that “complexity of words is measured by familiarity,” which really made me think differently about how I write. She shared several tips that I know will help strengthen my writing moving forward. I also got to meet Dr. Amina, a researcher working on the anti-cancer properties of bitterleaf, neem leaves, and turmeric, which I found very interesting. It was great connecting with her.

  Later in the day, we each worked on preprocessing the new datasets we collected. We looked for common columns across the files, cleaned out unnecessary data, and organized the image files into folders. It felt good to get hands-on with this part of the process and see how all the pieces start to come together. I do feel accomplished.

  The writing session with Professor Anita Pandey and her team was eye-opening. Learning how to structure a research paper and the different components of an abstract gave me a clearer sense of direction for writing. Her statement about complexity being tied to word familiarity really stuck with me—it’s something I’ll keep in mind when editing my work. Meeting Dr. Amina and hearing about her research on natural anti-cancer agents was also inspiring, and I’m glad I got a chance to connect with her.
  
Later on, working through the new datasets gave me a sense of progress. Organizing the images, finding shared columns, and cleaning out what we didn’t need helped make the data more manageable. It felt good to move from the theory of the morning into practical steps in the afternoon.
