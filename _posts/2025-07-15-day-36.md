  Things didn’t go as planned today, but we still got a lot out of it. We started with a general meeting to discuss our paper and where we currently stand. We also had a few interactive activities that were both fun and insightful. One of them was a bingo game where we had to walk around and find people who matched different descriptions—it was a nice way to learn more about each other.

  We also explored learning styles using the VARK model, and most of us in my team turned out to be multimodal learners. Then we went over our Myers-Briggs personality types and made a quick slide presentation about our results. Mine was ESFJ—“the provider”—which felt surprisingly accurate. After presenting, we got to listen to other groups during a gallery walk. I wasn’t feeling too well in the afternoon and had to leave early after lunch, but overall, the morning was engaging and gave us a break from the usual routine.

reflection: |
  The day took a different turn than expected, but it still offered some meaningful takeaways. The group meeting helped us reflect on how far we’ve come with our paper, and the activities that followed brought some needed energy. The bingo game was a fun way to connect, and learning about the VARK learning styles and our Myers-Briggs personalities gave a new layer of self-awareness. Creating a short slide on our personality types and presenting it made the activity feel more personal. I found it interesting that most of my team are multimodal learners, and my ESFJ result actually made sense to me. I had to leave early because I wasn’t feeling well, but I’m glad I showed up for the first part of the day.
