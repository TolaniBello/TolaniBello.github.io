what_i_learned: |
  Today, we started by working on our presentation slides, filling them in with everything we've been doing so far and assigning each person their part to present. Going over our progress reminded me of the goals we set during the first week, and honestly, it’s impressive how much we’ve accomplished—some even beyond what we planned. We also attempted to continue training our model but ran into a few issues that we hope to fix by tomorrow.

  Later, our graduate mentor, Dr. Saroj Pramanik, gave us a detailed session on the skin. He covered the different layers, structures, and components of the skin, reminding us that it’s the largest organ in the body. He talked about skin cancer—how common it is, with 1 in 5 people likely to develop it—and explained how it spreads through invasion and metastasis. He also mentioned the factors that increase risk, like radiation and skin type, signs/symptoms, and the difference between benign and malignant growths. It was a good refresher on things I had previously learned in human anatomy and physiology.

  Today helped me reconnect with the bigger picture of our project. Going over our slides and assigning parts for the presentation reminded me of the goals we set in the first week, and it was honestly encouraging to see how much we’ve achieved since then. Even though we ran into some issues while trying to train our model, I’m hopeful we can sort them out tomorrow. The session with Dr. Saroj Pramanik was a strong highlight—his breakdown of the skin, its layers, and the nature of skin cancer brought a deeper understanding to the research we’re doing. It also refreshed a lot of what I learned in anatomy and physiology. Days like this remind me how everything is starting to connect.
