  We Today was focused on digging deeper into key concepts in deep learning. We spent a good part of the morning watching tutorials on YouTube, covering terms like epoch, overfitting, underfitting, dropout, data augmentation, one-hot encoding, and visualizing convolutional filters. It wasn’t just about definitions—we also learned how these concepts work in practice and when they’re most useful in model training. It helped give more structure to things that had felt abstract before.

  In the afternoon, we each shared what we learned from the videos to help make the information stick. We met with all our mentors, and Blessing led a helpful review session that tied everything together. Later on, we reviewed some literature focused on fairness in AI to better understand the approaches and techniques other researchers have used. That part brought a lot of clarity, especially in relation to the coding work we’ve been doing. The discussions helped connect the theory to the actual goals of our project.

  Today was much better and more relaxed compared to the past few days. Spending the morning watching deep learning tutorials helped me understand some of the more complex terms we’ve been hearing, like overfitting, dropout, and one-hot encoding. It was a lot to take in, but having the time to just focus and listen made it easier to absorb. In the afternoon, discussing what we learned as a group really helped reinforce the information and clear up confusion. Meeting with our mentors and getting a review from Blessing tied everything together nicely. Reviewing the literature on fairness in AI also gave more meaning to the work we’re doing—it felt like things were finally connecting.
