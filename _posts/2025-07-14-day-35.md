  We continued preprocessing more of the new datasets—changing column names, mapping diagnosis names, and organizing the metadata. We used a script to derive the Fitzpatrick scale for some datasets, reviewed the results, and merged the values back into the metadata. We also downloaded the necessary images for the Fitz17k dataset and saved them into a folder for easier access.

  After that, we repeated the same preprocessing steps we used for the first three datasets on the four new ones. That brings us to a total of seven datasets we're now working with. It was a bit repetitive, but necessary for consistency. We ran into a few issues along the way, but thankfully, we were able to fix them without too much delay. It’s a lot of data to manage, but seeing it come together is encouraging.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Working through more datasets today felt like a lot, but also showed how much we’ve grown in handling and organizing complex data. Mapping the diagnosis names, renaming columns, and merging in the Fitzpatrick scale took time, but it made everything cleaner and more useful. Downloading and sorting the images for the Fitz17k dataset added another layer of work, but now we have everything in place.

  We now have about seven datasets, and applying the same process we used for the first three helped keep things consistent. It got a bit tiring at times, especially redoing similar steps, but it’s necessary for the quality of our project. We ran into some problems, but fixing them on time helped keep things moving.
