what_i_learned: |
  We finally trained our CNN model. The first attempt gave us a very low accuracy of 1%, but after changing some parameters, we got it up to 41%, which felt like solid progress. We also tested how long it would take the model to correctly predict the label of an image, and it got it right within three trials.

  Later, we went through the full code and assigned parts for each person to present. It was clear we need to read more and get more comfortable with the code and slides to explain things better. There were a few hiccups, and we’ll need more practice to clearly express our ideas. We continued working from where we left off and noted areas that still need attention.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  Fixing the model and seeing the accuracy improve from 1% to 41% made the work feel more real and rewarding. It showed that even small changes can have a big impact when you understand what you're adjusting. Going through the code and assigning presentation sections helped organize our thoughts, but it also made it clear that we still have a lot to review. Explaining the work out loud is different from just doing it, and it’s something we’ll need to keep practicing. The process felt a bit rough in places, but it also pushed me to take more ownership of what I’ve learned. There’s still work to do, but we’re getting closer.
