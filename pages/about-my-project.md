problem: |
  This research project focuses on developing and evaluating a trustworthy multimodal Al system for skin cancer detection. The project will integrate dermatoscopic images, clinical metadata, and machine learning models to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of Al-based skin cancer diagnosis. The study aims to address issues of bias, fairness, and explainability in existing Al models while using open-source datasets for model training and evaluation.
    

  The primary objectives of this research include: 
  Developing a deep learning pipeline that integrates image data with patient metadata for improved classification
  Investigating bias mitigation techniques to ensure fairness across diverse skin tones 
  Enhancing model explainability to support clinicians' decision-making and increase patient trust in Al diagnostics.

approach: |
  This project aims to develop a multimodal deep learning pipeline that integrates dermatoscopic images and patient metadata for more accurate and equitable skin cancer classification. We will:

- Use open-source datasets (HAM10000, PAD-UFES-20, MRA-MIDAS)
- Train convolutional and transformer-based models to handle multimodal input
- Implement bias mitigation strategies to ensure performance across diverse skin tones
- Apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to improve model interpretability
- Evaluate models based on accuracy, fairness, and explainability metrics


  Open-source tools such as OpenBCI, Python (MNE, Scikit-learn), and ROS (Robot Operating System) will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  By the end of the 10-week research period, the project will deliver:

A trained multimodal AI model for skin lesion classification
A fairness and bias evaluation report across demographic groups
Explainable visualizations (e.g., Grad-CAM, SHAP) for clinician transparency
A research paper and poster summarizing methods and findings

This project will provide hands-on experience in trustworthy AI development, with real-world applications in healthcare and medical AI.
